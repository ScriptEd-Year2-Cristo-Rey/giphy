# Giphy
This is the starter code for the Giphy API project.

After including the giphy.js file into your index.html you will be able to access the Giphy object. This object has 1 very useful function called "searchByWord". searchByWord takes 3 parameters: 
1) the query string
2) the number if images desired
3) a callback function to handle the response object

For more information on how the response object is formatted, consult the [Giphy API documentation](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI/blob/master/README.md)
